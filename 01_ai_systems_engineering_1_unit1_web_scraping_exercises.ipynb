            "\n",
            "2. **Features**: Attributes or properties of the data points; features are used as input for machine learning algorithms. Feature selection and engineering are critical to achieving higher model performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Labels**: In supervised learning, labels are the outputs or targets that the model aims to predict based on input features. They guide the learning process.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Model**: An abstraction or mathematical representation that learns from the training data. The model is adjusted during training to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Training**: The process of feeding data into the model so that it can learn the underlying patterns. During training, the model is fine-tuned to improve performance based on a specified cost function.\n",

            "   - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
            "   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving essential information (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy, especially when acquiring labeled data is expensive/ time-consuming.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Reinforcement Learning**: A framework where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It uses concepts like exploration versus exploitation. Popular algorithms include Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning (e.g., DQN, PPO).\n",
